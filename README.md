Creating a virtual python environment
```
# To create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv <name of virtual env>

# To activate the virtual environment
source <name of virtual env>/bin/activate

# Now you can install packages in the virtual environment using
pip install <package name>

# To list the packages installed in the virtual environment
pip list

# To delete the virtual environment
rm -rf <name of virtual env>

# To deactivate the virtual environment
# this will deactivate the virtual environment
# meaning the packages installed in the virtual environment
# will not be available in the global environment
# if you re-activate the virtual environment
# the packages will be available again
deactivate

```
